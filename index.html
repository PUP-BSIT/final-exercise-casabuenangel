			<h2>Mis Metas</h2>

			<h2>Journal</h2>
			<p>Let me share my story before I entered college. 
				I thought IT would be easy, just some clicking here and there,
				not until I stepped into this world.
				In the first week of the first year, 
				we were asked to introduce ourselves,
				and then immediately tasked to create a video about ourselves
				(I hate editing and designing). 
				Here's the link (only if you want to watch it):
				<a href="https://youtu.be/1kDt3B78-aQ?si=IcNsY2BMuPBw3aCN">
					Introducing Myself</a>
			</p>

			<p>ps: It's cringe-worthy, but I just want to put it here so I can
			   see and remember that this is how I used to edit before.
			</p>

			<p>To make a long story short, 
				fear surrounded me in the first and second year, 
				and I would attend classes just to feel nervous, 
				not necessarily to learn. 
				Before the third year, the thought that crossed my mind was,
				"Which professor will I be afraid of this time?" 
				Well, that's just how it is, I've gotten used to it.
			</p>

			<p>On the first Saturday of being a 3rd-year student, 
				I thought the schedule wouldn't be followed 
				because it was really killer, 
				from 7:30 am to 9:30 pm. No professor had ever gone that late.
				When our professor entered, 
				the aura was immediately intimidating. 
				First impression: Intimidating but cool.
				(I know this is not part of it, but I just want to add it.)
			</p>

			<p>So here we go!
				"What do you want to be?" 
				When I was younger, this was one of my favorite questions
				to answer because it was easy for me to say what I wanted 
				to happen in my life. I had the courage to shout out what 
				I wanted, and every year, my aspirations changed. One thing
				I wanted back then was to go to college so I could explore
				different places, knowing that I would study around
				Metro Manila. As I've grown older, ask about anything else, 
				just not this question, because to be completely honest, 
				I'm at a loss as to what I want. 
			</p>

			<p>Believe it or not, I never had favorites, 
				especially when it comes to school matters, 
				because I always thought it was unfair. However, 
				I've noticed in myself that I'm starting to have 
				favorite school days and professor. Every Saturday, 
				I never felt anxious except during Sir Steven's ice breaker 
				which is the recitation hehe! Saturday has become my 
				favorite because it's not only the last day of the school 
				week but also because of Sir's motivational phrases. This is
				my favorite quotes: "I push you off the cliff not for you to 
				fall but I want you to learn how to fly" and "Participation 
				over competition." It lightens the heart. It's amusing to think
				that after a few years, I found a strict professor but cool
				and I feel and know his sincerity in teaching and helping 
				us improve. I know he always understands us because he said,
				"I was once there, sitting where you are now." 
				I hope I can lend my diary to all of you who will read this, 
				so you can see that I'm not just making things up about Sir; 
				I'm telling the truth. Grrr!
				(I know I shouldn't be telling a story, 
				but it's really part of my journal.)
			</p>

			<p>As time goes by, I'm starting to find answers 
				to the question "What do you want to be?" especially 
				when Sir shared Madam Donna's story, which is truly inspiring.
				Also, as an average and non-privileged student, it's 
				heartening to hear a story that resonates with your life, 
				not because our lives are similar in a good way, but because 
				even though she wasn't exceptionally smart, talented, 
				or wealthy, She still manages to have a happy 
				and successful life.
			</p>

			<p>"Where do you want to be?" 
				Right now, I want to pursue the path I am currently taking,
				but I still don't know the exact thing I want, like 
				becoming a game developer, UI/UX Designer, 
				Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer? Nothing 
				like that yet, but for now,
				75% of me wants to enter the industry. I want to be there.
			</p>

			<p>I just want to share that now, as we're almost halfway through
				the 3rd year, I've learned that it's okay not to immediately
				understand the lesson because it's normal. Just strive to
				learn, don't feel pressured, don't be too grade-conscious.
				Focus on how you can understand some thing because 
				when you learn, grades will follow, enjoy the journey,
				and kahit na anong mangyari mag-ccode ka parin ̤̮ .
				I don't know if I answered the questions,
				but I hope so. I'm really bad at telling 
				stories and and answering questions, but there. 
				Hopefully, before I finish college, 
				I'll be 100% sure of what I want to be
				before entering the industry.
			</p>

			<p>See you when I see you.</p>
